# "Dracula" A Unity RTS Game Demo

This is a demo of a game development project created with Unity.

All scripts, shaders, and models were created by Adam Khaddaj and Leo McCarthy-Kennedy.

Character rigs / animations were made using Mixamo.

This is a prototype that mainly explores real time strategy systems such as hierarchical unit management, enemy AI behaviors, selection / UI handling, etc. 

Custom shaders are used for the reflective crystal textures, barrier textures, etc.  Lighting is handled using Unity's built in systems.
